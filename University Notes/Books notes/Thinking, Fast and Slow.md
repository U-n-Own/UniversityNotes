Daniel Kahneman's book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow," is a groundbreaking work that explores the two systems of thinking that govern our decision-making processes. He argues that we have two modes of thinking: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and operates automatically; and System 2, which is slow, deliberate, and requires effort.

Kahneman uses numerous examples to illustrate how these two systems work in different situations. He examines cognitive biases such as the availability heuristic (our tendency to judge the likelihood of an event by how easily we can recall similar events) and the anchoring effect (our tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive).

One of the key takeaways from Kahneman's book is that we often rely too heavily on System 1 thinking when making important decisions. This can lead us to make errors in judgment and miss important information. To mitigate this problem, we need to learn how to engage System 2 thinking more effectively.

Kahneman also highlights the importance of self-awareness in decision-making. By recognizing our own biases and limitations, we can improve our ability to make better decisions.

Overall, "Thinking, Fast and Slow" is an insightful book that challenges readers to think more deeply about their own thought processes. It provides practical advice for improving decision-making skills and offers valuable insights into human behavior. Anyone interested in psychology or decision-making will find this book a fascinating read.

## GPTs and the two Systems

**As an AI language model**, LLMs like ChatGPT or GPT4 are designed to `mimic` human language and thought processes. In some ways, they resemble System 1 thinking in the book, LLMs operate quickly and automatically, generating responses based on patterns and associations they have learned from vast amounts of data.

However, there are also important differences between LLMs and System 1 thinking. LLMs are not subject to the same cognitive biases and limitations as human beings. They do not have emotions, intuition, or personal experience that can influence their decision-making processes. In this sense, they are more similar to System 2 thinking in the book.

Like System 2 thinking, LLMs can engage in deliberate and effortful processing when necessary. They can analyze complex information and generate responses that take into account multiple factors. However, unlike System 2 thinking, LLMs do not experience mental fatigue or make errors due to limited attention or working memory.

Overall, while there are similarities between LLMs and both System 1 and 2 thinking processes, is important to recognize the unique capabilities and limitations of these different forms of thought processing. As AI technology continues to evolve, it will be important to consider how it can complement human decision-making processes rather than replace them entirely.


# What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI)

WYSIATI is cognitive bias described by Kahneman in the book, basically it means that we when taking decision or making judgments are more likely to use the System 1 why of thinking by doing so we can make irrational decisions some time, can be also view as "judging the book by the cover", without reading the book, we make judgments about the things we currently know, and we don't know a lot. We want to build a coherent chain of tought story when we try to explain and if we have some ground truth a priori (facts) we're biased toward using them and not thinking slowly ruminating over concepts, this is harder and this is why we have to stop and think in situations that matters.

### WYSIATI in learning

#personaltoughts

When we learn something we can do it in a lot of different ways, by doing errors and self learning from them by reading and integrating new ground truth, and we could also learn thing wrong. So why this happen? Maybe the thing we're learning is difficult and sometime we want just get to the state in which we can say : "Now i understood", that give us pleasure in a certain way. But worse than not understanding is misunderstanding concepts and learn them that way, we as humans can updates misunderstood facts to be the right ones, when discovering and thinking to new things we have to be careful to what we're thinking and if the `chain of reasoning result` is entailed by the truth we're trying to discover.

What System 1 is doing with facts is to build a story and maximizing confidence over that story, that confidence lead us astray, if we're missing some pieces we still don't know.

As said by Kahneman: 


```ad-cite
Well, the main point that i make is that *confidence* is a feeling, it's not a judgment.
