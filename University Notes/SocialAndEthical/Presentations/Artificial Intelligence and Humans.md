## About thinking

>Can machines think?

\- Alan Turing

Thinking is both

- Conscious (system 2): Agency, effortful thinking, writing slides. 

- Unconscious (system 1): Simple acts like breathing or compute 2+2 and waking up



---

Some objections to the machines' thinking argument was given like 


- Theleological objection
- Head in the sand objection
- Mathematical objection<!-- slide  --> 
---
  - Argument from Consciousness: 
	
>"Not until a machine can write a sonnet or
	compose a concerto because of thoughts and emotions felt, and not by the chance
	fall of symbols, could we agree that machine equals brainy that is, not only write
	it but know that it had written it. "

\- G.E.B. book

## Intelligence and AGI

We've discussed a lot of what differences human based intelligence from silicon based the artificial intelligence

>Intelligence: Ability to accomplish complex goals
---
But what is a *complex goal*, when is complex enough?

So we want to solve a goal-based problem.

- Interacting with a stochastic dynamic enviroment. (eg. Automated Driving)
- Finding how a protein should fold to have some specific property.
- Winning Go again word champion with a "creative move" (AlphaGo move 37)
- Playing Diplomacy at Human level.

*SuperIntelligence do it autonomously*


---
## Should AI replace humans?


---

Well we're not even sure they can.

---

## Conclusions

"Thinking is harder than showing intelligence"
