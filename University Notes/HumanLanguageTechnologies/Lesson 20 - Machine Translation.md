# Story of translation by machines

Traslating a text from a language to another *target language*: Autonomously.

In the years machine translation was really bad. 

Altavista was a page to translate pages, the engine used was Bablefish from famous novel

Babelfish from Hitchhiker guide to the galaxy.

More difficulties arised when we used chinese to english, maybe in chinese a character is 4 words in english so we need to capture this aspect as well

Plus in chinese there are no articles or pronouns. And some words like 'Ma' : 'Curtain' have multiple meaning depending on the context, we need to preserve as well the global meaning and not only by translating word by word, this is called adpatation from a language to another.

### Pessimism in MT

Initially was used in was to decode enigma messages, there was a report that argued about the fact that MT had to encode the entire human knowledge because in some phrases we could entail something that we can infer instead just by translating word by word the results are poor

### Language particularities

- Some language are universal while other diverge (specific thing not common with other languages)
- Typology:the study of systematic cross-linguistic similarities and differences
- Morphology: morphemes are the minimal *meaningful* units of language, word are composed by morphemes
- Stems: root + derivational morphemes: *hope*+ing becomes *hop*ing that is different from *hopp*ing
- Affixes: anti-*word*.
- Suffixes: *word*-ish
- Circumfixes

### Cold and Hot languages

Cold languages express concept in a more hidden manner and the reader must figure out, while hot languages are those that clearly say what they actually mean. 

Hot languages: Italian, English
Cold languages: Japanese, Chinese

### Head swapping

## Statistical MT

Rosetta Stone 

Centauri-Archturan traslation withou knowing languages

Example is `farok` trasnlated in sentence 5 and 7 to `jjat` because is the same word that appears in the phrase in the same spot

So we can say that Statistical Machine translation at least what we're seeing here is building a lookup table.
