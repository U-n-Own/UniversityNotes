A manifold is a k-dimensional surface embedded in $N$-dimensional state space which is defined by a set of equations

$$
M_j(x_1,x_2,...,x_N) = 0
$$

where $j = 1,2...,k \wedge k \lt N$

with $x_1,x_2,...,x_N$ elements of $N$-dimensional state of the system and $M_j$ is some function of those. The manifolds are called also **attractors** as in [[Fourth Midterm - AsymmetricRNN an architecture for long term dependancies preservation!#Attractors]] we cited. Manifold can be single point in state space, so point attractor, but can also be something like an orbit
