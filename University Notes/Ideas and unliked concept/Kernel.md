# Definition

```ad-abstract
A *Kernel* $\mathcal{K}$ is a function that measure the similarity of two inputs

$$
\mathcal{K}(x,x'|\tau)
$$

Where $\tau$ is a vector of hyperparameter used to tune the similarity
```

A kernel cannot be any function in fact as we briefly discussed of Kernel methods in ML course [[Kernel Method]].
