Notes based on the book: [[deeplearningbook.pdf]] chapter 9.

Neurophysiologists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel collaborated for several years to determine many of the most basic facts about how the mammalian vision system works.

In this simplified view, we focus on a part of the brain called *V1*, also known as the *primary visual cortex*. V1 is the first area of the brain that begins to perform significantly advanced processing of visual input. In this cartoon view, images are formed by light arriving in the eye and stimulating the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. The neurons in the retina perform some simple preprocessing of the image but do not substantially alter the way it is represented. The image then passes through the optic nerve and a brain region called the **lateral geniculate nucleus**. The main role, as far as we are concerned here, of both of these anatomical regions is primarily just to carry the signal from the eye to V1, which is located at the back of the head.
