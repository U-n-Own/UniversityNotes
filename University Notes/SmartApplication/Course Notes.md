### Team 2: LLM integration

### Team 3: Smart Report 

### Team 4: Bio applicative

# Project presentation

- 4 Weeks of conceptual design: study, explore... 
- Define how the project should be developed...
- Implement the thing
- Shit? Repeat.

## Aims:

Core is: what is the problem we're going to solve?

By using human centered approaches.

In industry 5.0 we aim to help 4.0 with problem it brought, so information overload. Now people have to learn things that are harder, so operators have responsability that cannot maintain.

## Assigment 1

For friday deepen the necessary things we need for the project, extend the text professor gave, what are the main aim, what API we need for example...


# Professor suggestions

## How to substructure our teams

How spotify organize teams? For our teams

We divided company in 4 main domain things, now we need another substructure, for example 3-4 people, for each subgroup we have someone that take the part to meet with the others. 

Frontend, Backend, Specification and ...

## Personas and final user stories

Let's define high level needs we want to address, those written at lesson are not ideal, we need to rewrite them

eg: Define KPIs

### Create syntetic data

Ideas: Moving average, but still we need an example of data
LSTM generation after a simple trained

# Notes during lessons
## Question to others 1:

 - First presentation:
	 1.  How to share KB
	 2. How do we plan to scale?
- Second presentation:
	 1. LLM large enough are capable to reach m


## Question to others 2:

- First presentation:
	1. Define better what they said more general review
	2. Define the domain of application, specifically
- Second presentation:
	 1. Copiare chatgpt
	 2. Statistical info about KPIs, meta KPI? Eg most correlated KPI
	 3. Develop a shared language to speak about different fields without: suggestion define a glossary?
- Third presentation:
	 1. Since team 2 and 3 work stricly with same clients we need that glossary to have coherence!
	 2. Real time data gathered via IOT devices for industrial (metal working and stuff like that)
	 3. Role management can't be in graphical user interface and in chatbot, we want a single source of privileges, by architectural point of view should be the interface. Also Role management isn't part of the minimum value product (MVP)
	 4. Another personas is the analysts (KPI Mainteiner)
- Fourth presentation:
	 1.  We need two personas, therapists and parents (See LLM interaction and other)
	 2. 
	 3. 
	

## User Stories meeting

*Requirements from the POV of the personas*

### Group 1

- Why only production data? KPI Maintainer are watching data in order to infer KPI. 
- Point 2 is wrong for the professor, there are overlaps on this role. There is another personas that do that. This guy is responsible for enabling the modeling. 
- Too much overlapping between KPI Analyst (Mauritzio) and other personas and lacking into some persona (Production manager) (Guglielmo the Solution Engieneer), sometimes there is users story but not the goal...
- KPI Maintained is the internal enabler of the solutions we want to propose.

### Group 2

- For the production manager as we said there's overlapping 
- Production engineer have to monitor consumption togheter with maintenance director (KPI is number of piece per energy consumption)


## User stories revisited

### Group 1



# SOTA

Critiques: Data collection organization or Wearable device with medical instruction capability, so close to medical data organization reporting higlighing difference or we place the product on a toolkit for analyzing data. We need to choose what we want to do we do not have time to do both



# Competitive Advantage

Two main things: Chatbot for doctors and Reports for both our users with different specialization with respect to user.

Add competitive advantage : smart report

Maybe knwoledge extraction is bind to KPI: Knowledge extraction from 3rd party data retreival


We want to compete with those other platform or collaborate: Maybe a Grammarly like is more aligned to what we want to do, be like a symbiosis system.



# Next time: MOCKUP

Use pen and paper stuff to create a system demo of our application
