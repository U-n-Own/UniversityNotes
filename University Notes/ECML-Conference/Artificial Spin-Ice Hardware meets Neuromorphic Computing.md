Entropy is non-zero, these are really difficult

Why? [[Residual Entropy]], emergent magnetic monopoles (nanomagnets).

We can produce a lot of these nanomagnets, we have two in two out configuration

States for 2in2out are good for energy, we can control these system much better.

## What is Nanomagnet

Thin films of permalloy (nickel and Fe), Spin oriented on long axis, flip in nanoseconds, system dynamics work in scale of seconds.

We have dipolar interactions.

[[Frustation]] property : If we have two in a certain direction the third connected and go alone one or another, this gives nice property.

Act close to Maxwell-Boltzmann ensemble of [[Icing Model]]

Second order effects are intresting

## Designs

Emergent topological constraint.

Computing? Well we have a piece of square ice and interpret as logic bit, each of these island is a bit. 

Input, Output and Bias (island)

## Spin Model

Mapping Hopfiled model to this, also island are not purely directed in a certain direction, we have additional degrees of freedom (magnons : emergent particles). Via FMR measurements

## Adding Reservoir 

How do we add reservoir? One can use bins associated to spectrum as a base, so counting number of "vortices" in the spectrum and use this parameter to perform 

Reservoir computing is more understandable if you know [[Hilber Space]], it's a system developing a bases in which we do regression and recover a target signal.

### Deep Reservoir architectures

Combine different spin ice structure for DRC, if we have three layer with short memory, long memory and strong non linearity (best combination)
