Occam Razor say simple desciption, MDL say short!

What's the difference?

Eg Shannon Entropy, measures statistical not individual complexity

We want a measure of complexity taking in account individual complexity, for example a Crystal code is the structure crystalline, for cat we have DNA.

Solution is [[Komologrov Complexity]] that is incomputable.

## MDL

Normalize, maximum likelihood distribution, the frist term noise and the second model cost (complexity of model family). Give me some data, if i can find some distribution in my model family then my model family is complex if it can do for every arbitrary data, if is big, is because
