## Project Idea

The goal of this project is to develop a genetic algorithm that teaches an agent to navigate a simple room using the Nethack learning environment. The objective of the agent is to reach the stairs, which serve as the goal in the room. The agent is allowed to move in the directions of East (E), South (S), West (W), and North (N). However, the presence of walls in the room adds complexity to the problem.

## Rule-based Approach

To solve the problem, the agent will apply a set of rules that guide its movement towards the goal. The goodness of each rule will be quantified using a function F, which will be defined later. The agent will iteratively improve its performance through the use of a genetic algorithm.

## Room Setup

The room used in the learning environment is a simple layout with walls and stairs. The agent's task is to navigate from its starting position to the stairs. The presence of walls complicates the problem and requires the agent to devise effective strategies to overcome obstacles.

## Quantifying Rule Goodness

The goodness of a rule will be evaluated based on how closely it brings the agent to the goal. A function F will be defined to measure the proximity of the agent to the goal after applying a particular rule. This function will serve as the fitness function in the genetic algorithm, guiding the evolution of the agent's behavior over time.

## Next Steps

1. Define the function F to quantify the proximity of the agent to the goal.
2. Develop the initial set of rules that guide the agent's movement.
3. Implement the genetic algorithm to optimize the agent's behavior.
4. Test and evaluate the performance of the agent within the Nethack learning environment.
5. Iterate and refine the genetic algorithm, rules, and evaluation metrics based on the experimental results.

By following these steps, we aim to create an agent that can effectively navigate the room towards the stairs using a genetic algorithm.

Please note that this document serves as an outline and can be expanded upon with further details, such as the specific genetic algorithm techniques to be employed, the implementation details, and the results obtained during testing and evaluation.
