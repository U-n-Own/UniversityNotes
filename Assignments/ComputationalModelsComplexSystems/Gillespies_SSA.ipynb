    "# Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw at lesson the SSA algorithm is used to simulate stochastic processes like reactions, we saw that when a system is not stochastic the reaction comes to an equilibrium and the system get's to a steady state what will happen with a stochastic system?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Foundations of SSA\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $m$ reactions $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_m$ and some molecules (or genes as we saw at lesson) $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_n$ we can write the notion of state as a vector on $n$ states $(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When will the next reaction occur?\n",
    "- Which reaction will occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we introduce the notion of propensity function $\\alpha_i$ for each reaction $R_i$.\n",
    "And we defien a probability distribution $P(\\tau, \\mu)$, where $\\tau$ is the time interval we're considering from $t$ to $t + \\tau$ and $R_\\mu$ is the reaction that will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call $c_\\mu$ our constant that determines the rate of reactions. Let's define $\\alpha_\\mu$ as the $\\color{red}{\\text{propensity}}$ of the system, that is the sum of all the propensities of the reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha_\\mu = h_\\mu c_\\mu\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h_\\mu$ is the number of molecules that can react : *Reactants*\n",
    "\n",
    "So $R_\\mu$ will be $l_1S_1 + ... + l_nS_n \\rightarrow^c p_1S_1 + ... + p_nS_n$\n",
    "Such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h_\\mu = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\binom{X_i}{l_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where propensity is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "So given a reaction set with certain propensities, we will use this as a parameter of an exponential distribution modelling the time between events occurrences. Remember that the exponential distribution is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(x;\\lambda) = 1 - e^{-\\lambda x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\lambda e^{-{\\lambda}x} \\;\\;\\;  x \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 \\;\\;\\; otherwise\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### An important point\n",
    "\n",
    "What we must remember is that this distribution is memoryless and if we consider a set of RV, their min $(X_{set})$ is exponentially distributed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memoryless: $F(x;\\lambda) = F(x + y;\\lambda) = F(y;\\lambda)$\n",
    "- Min($X_{set}$) is exponentially distributed: $X = min(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)$, then $X$ is exponentially distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the state of simulation with a vector the multiset of molecules in the system: $[X_1,...,X_n]$. A real variable $t$ that is our time initially at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iterates as follows until $t$ reaches a certain value $t_{max}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The time $t+\\tau$ so the time in which the next reaction will occur is given by the exponential distribution with parameter $\\alpha_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\alpha_i$.\n",
    "2. The reaction $R_\\mu$ that will occur at the time $t+\\tau$ is chosen randomly with probability $\\frac{\\alpha_\\mu}{\\sum \\alpha_i}$. This is $\\frac{\\alpha_\\mu}{\\alpha_0}$. This is the probability of the reaction to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "At each step $t$ is incremented by $\\tau$ and the state of the system is updated according to the reaction $R_\\mu$ that occurred."
